## Work Day Scheduler 

### This program is a simple day organizer for the hours between 9 and 5.  The user can input items on hour increments that are saved locally and will refresh when the page does.  The date is tracked in the header and the time is tracked internally so that the agenda hours are correctly colored to represent past, present and future time-blocks.

### This scheduler is created dynamically primarily using jquery.
